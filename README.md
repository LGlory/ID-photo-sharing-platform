### The project is built on C# and is divided into three modules.

        1. Server program

        2. Client program

        3. Web program

<br/><br/>

### **Server program**

The server program is built with ASP.NET Core, exposing the FESTful api, everything will start from here, it is the core component of the project.



###  **Client program**

Client program for windows, using WPF development, providing basic management functions



###  **Web program**

The web section is also the focus of the project. It will be developed by team members, but it may take a long time. I think the web section will provide the most comprehensive features.The web part may not be posted to my personal account.

This project is the first project of my university. It is developed by me personally. I will continue to update and refactor my C# learning. I hope it will be a quality project. I hope that the excellent language of C# will also be in the same district. The blockchain is just as hot.
